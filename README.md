# hololive-superchat-analysis

## Abstract
The key findings of this reports are
### To not rely on superchats as a key revenue source
- No significant growth in total superchat revenue
- No consistent increase in superchat volume or unique donators
- High variability in superchat donations for each vtuber
- High variability in superchat donations per stream

These insights suggest that Hololive may achieve greater revenue growth by exploring other monetization channels, such as merchandise sales and live events, rather than focusing heavily on superchats.

## Introduction
V-Tubing, where streamers use anime avatars instead of showing their faces, has become a major streaming niche. A key aspect of this culture is the "superchat" — a donation system that allows viewers to support streamers directly. This analysis focuses on Hololive, a leading V-Tuber agency, and aims to identify key trends within their superchat donations. By analyzing donation trends, we aim to uncover insights into audience behavior, geographical patterns, and potential business strategies for enhancing engagement and optimizing revenue.

### Data Source
Data was sourced from [Hololyzer](https://www.hololyzer.net/youtube/index.html). 

While most data were successfully extracted, some data points posed challenges during extraction and were excluded to streamline the analysis. These omissions are unlikely to significantly impact the overall insights.


## Results
### Plateau
The past few months of data is suggesting a plateau in superchat growth. 

The following graph shows the daily superchat per day. The number is stable, but is showing no signs of growth.

## Further Improvements
### Currency
The inclusion of currency data within the superchat transactions could reveal consumption patterns across different regions. By identifying countries with high donation volumes, targeted business strategies can be developed—such as offering region-specific merchandise or tailoring premium experiences to high-income areas.

### Demographics
Usernames within the superchat data could potentially be cross-referenced to infer demographic information such as age and gender. These insights would allow for more targeted marketing and business strategies tailored to specific user segments.

### Competitors
Comparative analysis with other V-Tuber agencies, such as Nijisanji, could provide additional insights into Hololive's performance relative to its competitors. Understanding unique donation behaviors within these agencies may highlight opportunities for Hololive to optimize engagement strategies.
